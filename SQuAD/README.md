# Question Answering Model on SQuAD 2.0 dataset
This project originated from the default final project of Stanford CS 224N. This [repository](https://github.com/minggg/squad) contains its starter code. You can read the original introduction updated on February 5, 2020 [here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/project/default-final-project-handout.pdf).

It is worth noting that the `environment.yml` in the original repository used `pytorch 1.0.0`, which is out-dated. I haved checked the starter code with `pytorch 1.7.0`.
